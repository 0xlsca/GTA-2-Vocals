# Hello!
This mod is basically just adding vocals throughout the game to add to the atmosphere.

The following scenarios are covered:

- Crafting:
  - Shotgun
  - Pistol
  - Machine gun
- Events:
  - Player death
  
**PLEASE NOTE:** The mod will **NOT** work our of the box! I do not own the rights on the vocals, therefore they are not included in the mod. 
**You not resolve this by inserting them by hand from the GTA II game files.**
***They NEED to be (re)converted first to OGG/Vorbis!***

The following files will need to be added in the following locations:

- resources/sounds/

  - sfx/
    - sfx_flamethrower.ogg
	- sfx_machinegun.ogg
	- sfx_pistol.ogg
	- sfx_punch.ogg (currently not in use)
	- sfx_rocketlauncher.ogg
	- sfx_shotgun.ogg
